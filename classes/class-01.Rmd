### Coding best practices ###

>   "Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."
>   --- Hadley Wickham

### File Names

* File names should be meaningful and end in `.R`, `.Rmd`, etc.
* Avoid using special characters in file names - stick with numbers, letters, `-`, and `_`. 
* *Never* include spaces in file names! 

```{show-code}
    ###### Good  
    fit_models.R  
    utility_functions.Rmd  

    ###### Bad  
    fit models.R  
    foo.r  
    stuff.r  
```

* If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers. 
* If it seems likely you'll have more than 10 files, left pad with zero. 
* It looks nice (constant width) and sorts nicely. 

```{show-code}
    00_download.R  
    01_explore.R  
    ...  
    09_model.R  
    10_visualize.R  
```

* Avoid capitalizing when not necessary. 
* If you want to include dates in your file name, use the ISO 8601 standard: `YYYY-MM-DD`
* Use delimiters intentionally! (helps you to recover metadata easily from file names)
* For example, "_" to delimit fields; "-" to delimit words

```{show-code}  
2019-02-15_class1_data-wrangling.Rmd
```

* Avoid hard coding file names and instead use relative paths. 
* `~` represents the current working directory. 
* Use `getwd()` to figure out what your working directory is. 

```{show-code}
###### Good
"~/class1/code/test.R"
    
###### Bad
"/Users/sjaganna/Desktop/CU-onedrive/08-teaching/molb7910/class1/data.csv"
```

---

### Organisation

* Try to give a file a concise name that evokes its contents
* One way to organize your files is by grouping them into `data`, `code`, `plots`, etc. 
* For example, in **this class** we often use the following structure:  

```{show-code}
      exercises
         - exercises-01.Rmd
         - data
         - img
         - setup
         ...
```

---

### Internal structure of code

Use commented lines of `-` and `=` to break up your code chunk into easily readable 
segments. Or better yet, make each "action" it's own chunk and give it a name. 

```{show-code}
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```

### R Basics - Overview ###

* R, Rstudio (Exercise #1)
* R as a calculator (Exercise #2)
* Functions and arguments (Exercises #3-4)
* Data types: numeric, character, logical (& more) (Exercise #5)
* Data structures: vector, list, matrix, data frame, tibbles (Exercises #6-7)
* Package system, Rstudio, and Rmarkdown (Exercises #8-9)

### R vs Rstudio - Exercise 1

What is R? What is Rstudio?

* R is a programming language used for statistical computing
* RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, terminal, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, tools for plotting, history, workspace management, and much more. 
* You can use R without RStudio, but not the other way around. 

Let's do the following to explore Rstudio: 

* Look at Rstudio panels one at a time
* Environment, History, Console, Terminal, Files, Plots, Packages, Help, etc. 

### R as a calculator - Exercise 2

* R can function like an advanced calculator

- try simple math
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 + 3 * 5     # Note the order of operations.
3-7           # value of 3-7
3/2           # Division
5^2           # 5 raised to the second power
# This is a comment line
```

- assign a numeric value to an object
```{r, eval=FALSE}
num <- 5^2    # we just created an "object" num
```

- print the object to check
```{r, eval=FALSE}
num
```

- do a computation on the object
```{r, eval=FALSE}
num+100
```
Note: Objects can be over-written. So be careful if you reuse names. 

---

### Functions and arguments - Exercise 3

* Functions are fundamental building blocks of R
* Most functions take one or more arguments and transform an input object in a specific way. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
log
?log
log(4)
log(4, base = 2)
```
---

### Writing a simple function - Exercise 4

```{r, eval=FALSE}
addtwo <- function(x) {
              num <- x + 2
              return(num)
}

addtwo(4)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f <- function(x, y) {
  z <- 3 * x + 4 * y
  return(z)
}

f(2, 3)
```

### Questions?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data types ###

* There are many data types in R. 
* For this class, the most commonly used ones are **numeric**, **character**, and **logical**. 
* All these data types can be used to create vectors natively.

### Data types - Exercise 5
```{r}
typeof(4) # numeric data time
typeof("suja") # character data type
typeof(TRUE) # logical data type
typeof(as.character(TRUE)) # coercing one data type to another
```

---

### Data structures ###

* R has multiple data structures. 
* Most of the time you will deal with tabular data sets, you will manipulate them, take sub-sections of them. 
* It is essential to know what are the common data structures in R and how they can be used. 
* R deals with named data structures, this means you can give names to data structures and manipulate or operate on them using those names.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-structures.png")
```

### Tibbles
* A __tibble__, or `tbl_df`, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. 
* Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). 
* This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. Tibbles also have an enhanced `print()` method which makes them easier to use with large datasets containing complex objects.
* `tibble()` does much less than `data.frame()`: 
    - it never changes the type of the inputs 
    - it never changes the names of variables
    - it never creates `row.names()`

### Vectors - Exercise 6

- Vectors are one of the core R data structures. 
- It is basically a list of elements of the same type (numeric,character or logical). 
- Later you will see that every column of a table will be represented as a vector. 
- R handles vectors easily and intuitively. 
- The operations on vectors will propagate to all the elements of the vectors.

Create the following vectors
```{r, eval=FALSE}
    x <- c(1,3,2,10,5) #create a vector named x with 5 components
                       # `c` is for combine
                       # you could use '=' but I don't recommend it.
    y <- 1:5           #create a vector of consecutive integers y
    y + 2              #scalar addition
    2*y                #scalar multiplication
    y^2                #raise each component to the second power
    2^y                #raise 2 to the first through fifth power
    y                  #y itself has not been unchanged
    y <- y*2           #here, y is changed
```

---

### Data frames - Exercise 7

- A data frame is more general than a matrix, in that different columns can have different modes (numeric, character, factor, etc.). 
- A data frame can be constructed by data.frame() function. 
- For example, we illustrate how to construct a data frame from genomic intervals or coordinates.

Create a dataframe `mydata`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
    chr <- c("chr1", "chr1", "chr2", "chr2")
    strand <- c("-", "-", "+", "+")
    start <- c(200,4000,100,400)
    end <-c(250,410,200,450)

    mydata.df <- data.frame(chr, strand, start, end) # creating dataframe
    mydata.df
    
    mydata.tbl <- tibble(chr, strand, start, end) # creating a tibble
    mydata.tbl
```

---

### R packages - Exercise 8

* An R package is a collection of code, data, documentation, and tests that is easily sharable
* A package often has a collection of custom functions that enable you to carry out a workflow. eg. DESeq for RNA-seq analysis
* The most popular places to get R packages from are CRAN, Bioconductor, and Github. 
* Once a package is installed, one still has to "load" them into the environment using a `library(<package>)` call. 

Let's do the following to explore R packages
* Look at the "Environment" panel in Rstudio
* Explore Global Environment
* Explore the contents of a package

---

### Rmarkdown Exercise - Exercise 9

* Rmarkdown is a fully reproducible authoring framework to create, collaborate, and communicate your work. 
* Rmarkdown supports a number of output formats including pdfs, word documents, slide shows, html, etc. 
* An Rmarkdown document is a plain text file with the extension `.Rmd` and contains the following basic components: 
    - An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s.
    - Chunks of R code surrounded by ```.
    - Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.

Let's do the following to explore Rmarkdown documents
* Create a new .Rmd document
* `knit` the document to see the output
